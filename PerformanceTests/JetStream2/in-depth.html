    <h1>In Depth Analysis</h1>

    <p>
    JetStream 2 combines together a variety of JavaScript and Web Assembly benchmarks, covering a variety of
    advanced workloads and programming techniques, and reports a single score that
    balances them using a geometric mean.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each benchmark measures a distinct workload, and no single optimization
    technique is sufficient to speed up all benchmarks. Some benchmarks demonstrate tradeoffs, and
    aggressive or specialized optimizations for one benchmark might make another benchmark slower.
    JetStream 2 rewards browsers that start up quickly, execute code quickly, and continue running smoothly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Each benchmark in JetStream 2 computes its own individual score. JetStream 2 weighs each
    benchmark equally, taking the geometric mean over each individual benchmark's score to compute
    the overall JetStream 2 score.
    </p>

    <p>
    It's not enough to just measure the total running time of a workload.
    Browsers may perform differently for the same JavaScript workload depending on how many times it
    has run. For example, garbage collection runs periodically, making some iterations take longer than
    others. Code that runs repeatedly gets optimized by the browser, so the first iteration
    of any workload is usually more expensive than the rest.
    </p>

    <p>
    For most of the JavaScript benchmarks in JetStream 2, individual scores
    equally weigh startup performance, worst case performance, and average case
    performance. These three metrics are crucial to running performant JavaScript
    in the browser. Fast startup times lead browsers to loading pages more quickly. Good
    worst case performance ensures web applications can run without hiccups. Fast average
    case performance makes it so that the most advanced web applications can run at all.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    For JetStream 2's Web Assembly benchmarks, individual scores equally weigh startup time and
    total execution time. An important component of JetStream 1 were the asm.js subset of benchmarks. With the release
    of Web Assembly, the importance of asm.js has lessened since many users of asm.js are
    now using Web Assembly. JetStream 2 has converted many of the asm.js benchmarks from
    JetStream 1 into Web Assembly.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    All but one of JetStream'2 JavaScript benchmarks run for N iterations, where
    N is usually 120. JetStream 2 reports the startup score as the time it takes to run the first iteration.
    The worst case score is the average of the worst M iterations, excluding the first iteration.
    M is always less than N, and is usually 4. The average case score is the average
    of all but the first iteration. These three scores are weighed equally using the geometric
    mean.
    </p>

    <p>
    JetStream 2 also includes a JavaScript benchmark named WSL. WSL is an implementation of a
    GPU shading language written in JavaScript. WSL does not use the above mechanism for scoring
    because it has a long running time. Instead, the WSL benchmark computes its score as the
    geometric mean over two metrics: the time it takes to compile the WSL standard library, and the time
    it takes to run through the WSL specification test suite.
    </p>

    <p>
    JetStream 2 includes parts of these benchmark suites that came before it: <a href="https://webkit.org/perf/sunspider/sunspider.html">SunSpider</a>,
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/octane/">Octane 2</a>, <a href="https://browserbench.org/JetStream/">JetStream 1</a>,
    <a href="https://browserbench.org/ARES-6/">ARES-6</a>, and <a href="https://v8.github.io/web-tooling-benchmark/">Web Tooling Benchmark</a>.
    JetStream 2 also includes new benchmarks inspired by <a href="https://krakenbenchmark.mozilla.org">Kraken</a>.
    JetStream 2 also includes a new set of benchmarks that measure the performance of Web Assembly, Web Workers,
    Promises, async iteration, unicode regular expressions, and JavaScript parsing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Note that scores from JetStream 2 are not comparable to scores to other versions
    of any JetStream benchmark.
